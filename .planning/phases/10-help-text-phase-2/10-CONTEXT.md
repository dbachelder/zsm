# Phase 10: Help Text Phase 2 - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The help text should have a clean two-color system that makes keybindings instantly scannable. Looking at the strider layout manager screenshot as inspiration — the key combos pop visually against the action labels.

When you glance at the help bar, your eye should immediately find the key you need because of the color contrast, not because you're reading through text.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Color contrast** — The visual pop between keys and labels is the priority
- **Two-color system** — Keys (including angle brackets) in pink/magenta, labels in white
- **Scannable** — Eye finds the key first, then reads what it does

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Key + angle brackets all in one color (pink/magenta): `<Enter>`, `<Del>`, `<↑↓>`
- All action labels in white
- Reference: strider layout manager help text style (screenshot provided)
- Keep it simple — no multiple label colors, just the two-color key/label distinction

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Current ZSM help text uses cyan for session names. This phase focuses specifically on the help bar at the bottom — making keybindings visually distinct from their descriptions.

The goal is visual scannability, not information density changes.
